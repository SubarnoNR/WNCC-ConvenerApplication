# WNCC-ConvenerApplication
This contains the code and required files for task 2 of the Convener Application Assignment

### Dependancies :

1. Requires Chrome version 90.0 for the driver to work, if using another version, make sure to install the suitable webdriver in the same directory
2. Python libraries to be installed:
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas

### Demonstration :
1. Run the following code in the terminal, and enter the name of the state:

2. The code fetches the data from (https://www.covid19india.org/) and stores the information in stateinfo.csv

3. For some states the district wise data is not available in the website, so the code outputs the total cases of the state:

4. If the state name entered is incorrect, a prompt asking to user to recheck the state name is output :

#### Honour Code :

I guarantee that all the code used in this project is my own (except some things I may have picked up from the python libraries documentation ofc), and I have not used any unfair means for the completion of this project.
