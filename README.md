# WNCC-ConvenerApplication
This contains the code and required files for task 2 of the Convener Application Assignment

### Dependancies :

1. Requires Chrome version 90.0 for the driver to work, if using another version, make sure to install the suitable webdriver in the same directory
2. Python libraries to be installed:
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas

### Demonstration :












I guarantee that all the code used in this project is my own(expect some things I may have picked up from the python libraries documentation ofc), and I have not used any unfair means for the completion of this project.
